# Run tests and fix failures

1. Run the project's test suite (e.g. `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, `go test`, etc.).
2. If tests exist and fail:
   - Analyze the failures
   - Fix the code
   - Re-run tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass
3. If no tests exist, say so and suggest where tests would help.
4. Report what passed and what was fixed.
